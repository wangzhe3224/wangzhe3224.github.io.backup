Liquidity risk:

A key function of banks is to channel savers’ deposits to
people that wish to borrow. But lending is an inherently risky
business. Understanding the concepts of a bank’s capital and
liquidity position helps shed light on the risks the bank takes
and how these can be mitigated.

Capital can be thought of as a bank’s own funds, in contrast to
borrowed money such as customer deposits. Since capital can
absorb losses, it can mitigate against credit risk. In order to
prevent balance sheet insolvency, the more risky assets a bank
is exposed to, the more capital it is likely to need. Meanwhile,
in stressed market conditions, it is possible that banks find
that they do not hold sufficient cash (or assets that can easily
be converted into cash) to repay depositors and other
creditors. This is known as liquidity risk. A stable funding
profile and a buffer of highly liquid assets can help to mitigate
this risk.
